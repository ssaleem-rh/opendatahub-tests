    Preconditions:
        - InferenceService deployed and ready
        - Model accepts application/json content type

    Test Steps:
        1. Create InferenceService with OVMS runtime
        2. Wait for InferenceService status = Ready
        3. Send POST to inference endpoint with header Content-Type: text/xml
        4. Send POST with header Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        5. Capture responses for both requests
        6. Verify model pod health status

    Expected Results:
        - HTTP Status Code: 415 Unsupported Media Type for invalid Content-Types
        - Error indicates expected content type is application/json
        - Model pod remains healthy (Running, no restarts)
